                    NFS Server and Client Configuration in Ubuntu
*************************************************************************************************

#STEPS TO CONFIGURE NFS

#Setting up a NFS server with an NFS share
#Installation of NFS Server in UBUNTU

$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

#Creating a root NFS Directory
Creating root directory of NFS shares also know as "Export Folder".

$sudo mkdir /mnt/myshare

Setting permissions so that any user can access the folder on the Client Machine.

$sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/myshare


#Defining the access for NFS client in export file
- To grant access to NFS client, I need to define an Export File ( Located at /etc/exports)
- Editing the /etc/exports in a text editor, and add one of the following three directories.

1) To enable to a Single Client:-  /mnt/myshare 10.0.2.15(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

2) to enable access to several users:-  /mnt/myshare {ClientIP-1}(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
                                                     {ClientIP-2}(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
                                                     {ClientIP-3}(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
                                                     ......
3) To enable access to an entire subnet:-  /mnt/myshare {subnetIP}/{subnetMask}(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)


#To Make sure NFS share is available to the CLIENT
We can make shared directory available to client using the "exportfs" command.
After runnung this command, the NFS Kernel should be restarted.

$sudo exportfs -a     #making file share available
$sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server   #Restarting the NFS kernel



#NOW WE'LL SET UP NFS ON CLIENT'S MACHINE AND MOUNT NFS SHARE

$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install nfs-common


#Mounting nfs share temporarily
-mounting nfs folder to a specific location on the local machine is known as "mount point"
Using the following commands:-

1) CREATE LOCAL DIRECTORY - This will be the mount point for the NFS Share

$sudo mkdir /var/local-mount

2) Mount the file share by running the mount command

$sudo mount -t nfs {IP of NFS server}:{Folder path on server} /var/local-mount
For Example:- $sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.10:/mnt/myshare /var/local-mount

3) To verify the the NFS share is mounted successfully, run the command

$df -h


#MOUNTING NFS file shares permanentaly
-Remote NFS directories can be automatically mounted when the local system is automatically mounted
when the local system is started.
-Can be defined in the " /etc/fstab " file

-To ensure an NFS file share is mounted locally on startup. You need to add a line to this file with relevant file share details.

4) Create local directory that will be used to mount the file share.

$sudo mkdir /var/local-mount

5) Edit the " /etc/fstab " file using the nano command or any text editor.

6) Add a line defining the NFS share . Insert  Tab character between each parameter. IT should appear as one line with no line break.

${IP of NFS-SERVER}:{Folder path on server} /var/local-mount nfs defaults 0 0


7) Now mount file share using the following command.

$mount /var/local-mount
$mount {IP of NFS-SERVER}:{folder path on server}

the next time the system starts, the folder will be mounted automatically.
